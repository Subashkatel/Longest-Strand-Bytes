# Longest-Strand-Bytes
 # Problem
 Given a large number of binary files, write a program that finds the longest strand of bytes that is identical between two or more files.
 
 The program should display:
 - the length of the strand 
 - the file names where the largest strand appears
 - the offset where the strand appears in each file
